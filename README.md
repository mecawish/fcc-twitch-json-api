# fcc-twitch-json-api
freeCodeCamp's "Use the Twitch JSON API"

A page that will show Twitch channels' status and display details if currently streaming using Twitch.tv's JSON API. Used jQuery and Bootstrap. This is a project I did years back on codepen https://codepen.io/mecawish/full/BRegeR which is now included in freeCodeCamp's Take Home Projects.
